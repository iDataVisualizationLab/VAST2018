A row represents a measure at a location over the time. A cell is a representation of the measured values in a particular month for a particular location. There are several individual extremely large values but hard to confirm if they are outliers, so circles are used to represent these values. The color of a cell represents the averaged measured value with the color scale shown in (a). The thickness of the border of a cell represents sampling frequency (number of samples per element per month per location), the thicker the border is the higher the frequency. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">There is a control panel (b) to set the view such as grouping options (location or measure), options to order the locations (alphabetical, similarity, down-stream, distance from the dumping place, or sampling frequency), options to order the measures (alphabetical, similarity, or sampling frequency). Since there is a large number of cells and cannot fit all of them into one single screen, there is an option to set the height of the cells to a smaller number to have an overview of all elements or to set it to larger number to have a clearer view. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">There are also some other floating panels to assist the analysis, such as a Line graph viewer, a Detail view, and a Map Viewer. The Line graph viewer (c) on which user could drag and drop one or more rows to show the distribution of measure(s) over time for further investigation when needed. Once a user clicks on a cell it displays all the details on the Detail view (d).

Its behavior could be classified into three main groups as dropping (a1), increasing (a2), and rapidly increasing to an extremely high level (a3).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c8">At Busarakhan, Kannika, Sakda, and Boonsri, Methylosmoline was dropping (a1) and behaved similarly except at Boonsri on November 2015. However, this could just be an outlier since 3 measures made on that and two were quite close to the overall normal value and only one is at very high (a1a). At Chai, Methylosmoline was fluctuating but mainly increased in 2015 and reduced to a relatively high level in 2016 (a2).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c8">One suspicious point that we discovered is that Methylosmoline was increasing starting in 2015 and became extremely high in 2016 onward at Somchair and Kohsoom (a3). These extremely high values suggested us to look for some anomalies and/or mis-report issues, however, we could not find any strong evidence of such from the data. Therefore, we could suspect that companies dump Methylosmoline in these places in 2015 and very much in 2016 and early 2017 led to an extremely high level of Methylosmoline in these places.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c8">Regarding AGOC-3A, except for the extremely high values at Boonsri on Jan 11, 2015, this probably due to outlier or mistake (see (c1a) and (c1b) for further details), its values were fluctuating but the main trend was dropping by the end of 20015 and early 2016. This is suspicious since AGOC-3A should be increasing as it is an environmental-friendly replacement for Methylosmoline and Chlorodinine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c14 c8">All in all, Chlorodinine was reduced as expected, but the suspicious behavior is that at the end of 2015 and early 2016, AGOC-3A was reducing and Methylosmoline was increasing. This could suggest that companies were getting back to using Methylosmoline instead of AGOC-3A starting from 2015.</span></p><a id="id.s2w4q6smmxe"></a><p class="c24 c31"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 1083.30px; height: 354.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image2.png" style="width: 1083.30px; height: 354.00px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c17" id="h.3znysh7"><span class="c2">Figure 3.

The first one is the continuous increment of Anionic active surfactants (AAS) at Kohsoom from early 2015 onward (a). This suggested us to look into the details of this element (a1) and confirmed the increment. AAS are found commonly in detergents or washing agents, AAS are toxic to humans and marine organisms, so its continuous increment would introduce ecotoxicological impact on the river organisms at Kohsoom and so affect the bird distribution there. Similarly, our visualization also noticeably suggests another the increment of Dissolved silicates at Kohsoom in early 2013 (overview (b) and details (b1)), this could be explained for some construction/building activities there, unfortunately, the data was discontinued after that.</span></p><a id="id.3jw38irmyr4"></a><p class="c20"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 1083.30px; height: 794.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image5.png" style="width: 1083.30px; height: 794.00px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c17" id="h.2et92p0"><span class="c2">Figure 4.

However, it is also worth to consider that all these measures were at the same constant value of 0.1 for Sulfides for the whole year 2008 (a1) and of 0.5 for Atrazine for 3 continuous years 2008, 2009, and 2010 (b1) at all locations. This is very similar behavior for Mercury to be at a constant high value of 1.0 in the whole year 2008 at Achara. On the other hand, these were measured several times in a month for each measure at each location, as the thick borders of the cells in (a, b). For instance, in August 2008, Sulfides was measured 12 times but resulted in the same constant value of 0.1 (a2) and Atrazine at Kannika was measured for 3 times on May 05, 2008 and resulted in a constant value of 0.5 (b2). These, at the same time, may also suggest that these constantly high values might be accurate. All in all, though all these are at very high values might imply issues, being at constant values for a long time may suggest data sampling anomalies. Therefore, further investigation is needed in order to make a conclusion.</span></p><a id="id.a3igy23bpxn1"></a><p class="c24 c31"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 1085.30px; height: 625.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image4.png" style="width: 1085.30px; height: 625.00px; margin-left: 0.00px; margin-top: 0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c17" id="h.tyjcwt"><span class="c2">Figure 5.

These suggested us to look into the details distribution of these elements in all locations and found out that the Total dissolved phosphorus was high (a1) while the Dissolved oxygen was relatively low (b1) at Kohsoom comparing to the other locations. Similarly, it is noticeable that several other values are being relatively high in several years at Kohsoom comparing to other locations such as Total nitrogen (c), Ammonium (d), Orthophosphate-phosphorus (e) and several more. All these imply that Kohsoom a suspicious place.</span></p><a id="id.o4d5ijc31p0h"></a><p class="c24 c31"><span style="overflow: hidden; display: inline-block; margin: 0.00px 0.00px; border: 0.00px solid #000000; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); width: 1078.50px; height: 149.00px;"><img alt="" src="images/image7.png" style="width: 1078.50px; height: 149.00px; margin-left: -0.00px; margin-top: -0.00px; transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px); -webkit-transform: rotate(0.00rad) translateZ(0px);" title=""></span></p><p class="c17" id="h.3dy6vkm"><span class="c2">Figure 6.

However, their constant colors over the periods and their overall signatures (a1, c1) suggested us to look into their detail distributions (a2, b2, c2). These show that Sulfides was high but being at a constant value of 0.1 for the whole year 2008 at all locations, Mercury was high but remained at 1.0 for the whole year 2010 at Achara, and Atrazine was high at 0.5 in 3 continuous years 2008, 2009, and 2010 at all locations.

Therefore, if it is possible higher sampling frequency is expected. In addition, the sampling frequencies should be consistent among locations.

However, AGOC-3A was dropped at the end of 2015 and early 2016 and remained low, at the same time Methylosmoline was increasing in several places (high at Chai and extremely high at Somchair and Kohsoom). This would suggest that Methylosmoline was used again instead of AGOC-3A starting at the end of 2015 and the end of 2016 (as shown in </span><span class="c10 c13"><a class="c9" href="#id.qpbw3sbkya37">Figure 2</a></span><span class="c14 c8">).
